Lindacare-test

Sorry guys I don't have much time for this test.
I just have just done the Message Consumption, I have lost a little to much time on it, should have rush more.

I the thing that I wanted to add there is the end of the swagger UI, a JWT implementation and a spring security verification role on the method.

You will maybe need to install mongoDB on your computer, but you just run the test, there is already a MongoDB embedded.

See you.
